This project is a epidemic spread simulation.
On a 2D canvas, people — represented as small squares — move randomly. When they collide with each other, they interact, and the disease can spread through these interactions.
In this pandemic spread simulation, individuals move randomly, interact upon collision, and can become infected, recover.
Factors such as mask usage, social distancing, and sociability affect the probability of infection.
I have a "report.pdf" about explanation
